*As a [type of user], I want to [do something] so that [goal/value].*

**Example:**

**Example:**
*As a product manager, I want to filter tasks by priority so I can quickly identify the most urgent items on the dashboard.*

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- A checklist of testable outcomes to ensure the feature meets its goals -->

**Example:**
- [ ] Users can filter entries by status, priority, and date range
- [ ] The filtered results are reflected immediately in the UI
- [ ] Filters persist across browser refreshes (via localStorage)
- [ ] The backend supports `/api/entries?status=...&priority=...` queries
- [ ] Unit tests cover all filtering logic

## Implementation Notes
<!-- Optional: Describe how the feature was implemented, any challenges, or technical details worth noting -->
**Example:**

- Implemented a reusable FilterPanel component for all list-based views (Tasks, Projects, Events).
- Refactored the /api/entries controller to support query string filtering with validation.
  - Concern: The `applyFilters()` utility currently does not support filtering by nested fields (e.g., user.role). This limitation affects some edge cases on the Admin Dashboard.
- Added a temporary workaround by flattening nested objects before applying filters, but this may have performance implications on large datasets.
- Opened a separate issue (#132) to explore a more scalable solution using a query builder or database-level filtering.
- Unit tests written for all new logic, but integration tests for Admin-specific filters are still pending (planned for next PR).
